# UtilityKare
UtilityKare is a BepInEx Plugin which is supposed to help with creating Mods for KoboldKare,  
by assisting with certain steps that would otherwise be needed (at the time of writing).

### Current Features  
- [Custom Reagents](#custom-reagents) to create new Scriptable Reagents, or modify existing ones.
- [Custom Reagent Reactions](#custom-reagent-reactions) to make two reagents form a new one!
- [Custom Localization](#custom-localization) to make use of LocalizedString's , like in Reagents!
- [Version Control](#version-control) to ensure others can only join if they have the mod/s as well!
